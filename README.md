## üßê About <a id = "about"></a>

Using this platform, you can easily create your own English courses for native speakers of any language. The project works using a user-friendly and simplified interface, which will greatly facilitate the work of both the course owner and the students who will take this course. 

Due to the fact that the project development process was carried out with the help of my English teacher, the learning process on such a platform will be as effective as possible in learning the necessary English language

You can try this platform at https://englishtime.website/ (available in 3 languages)

To run the program locally, simply clone the repository and execute the start script:
```
git clone https://github.com/dmisl/EnglishTime.git
cd <project_directory>
php start.php
```
This script automates all necessary setup steps, including installing PHP/JS dependencies, setting up environment variables, running migrations, starting the development server

Once the script completes, your program will be up and running, ready for you to use.

To run the program using Docker:

Before running Docker commands, update the .env file with your database configuration.

```
DB_HOST=database

```
then run
```
php start.php
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
